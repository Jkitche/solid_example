[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# XXX: ignoring E0203 since decorators add class members.
#   - Example: /src/trustedpath/adminserv/administrators.py:1847
# XXX: ignoring E0401 since pylint can't import our third-party libraries.
# XXX: ignoring E0611, which checks for import errors when using
#      "from x import y" syntax. It produces many false positives because
#      audits currently run on our whole codebase, including module imports
#      that don't work for the current flavor.
# XXX: ignoring E1002 since pylint gets confused about parent/super class things
# XXX: ignoring E1101 and E1103 due to tons of FPs, needs investigation
# XXX: ignoring E1120 since THEY'RE EVERYWHERE I CAN'T FIGHT THEM ALL.
# XXX: ignoring E1137 since pylint gets doesn't like variables initialized as `None`.
